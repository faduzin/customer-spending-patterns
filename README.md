# Multi-Dataset Clustering: A K-Means Experiment

This project explores the concept of clustering in data science, focusing on the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups data points based on their similarities, allowing us to uncover hidden patterns and structures in datasets without predefined labels.

This repository contains end-to-end analyses for two datasets (Iris and Mall Customers), applying K-Means clustering to identify spending patterns and segment groups.

## Background

This project was created to practice and summarize the concepts I have learned about unsupervised learning, specifically focusing on clustering techniques. Unsupervised learning is a powerful tool for discovering hidden patterns and structures in datasets without predefined labels, and this project serves as a hands-on application of those principles.

The project contains a comprehensive analysis of two datasets: one focusing on customer spending patterns and the other on the Iris flower dataset. Through the application of K-Means clustering, I aim to demonstrate how unsupervised learning can segment data into meaningful groups. The results from both datasets will be analyzed and compared, providing insights into the effectiveness of clustering techniques in various contexts.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer learns from data without being told what to look for. Imagine you have a big box of mixed Lego pieces, but no instructions. You don't know exactly what you're supposed to build, but you can start sorting the pieces by color, size, or shape. This is similar to what happens in unsupervised learning.

In supervised learning, the computer is given examples with correct answers (like showing pictures of cats and dogs and labeling them). But in unsupervised learning, there are no labels or correct answers. The computer tries to find patterns, group similar things together, or detect anything unusual all by itself.

Here are two common ways unsupervised learning is used:

- **Clustering:**
This is like organizing your Lego pieces into groups. The computer looks at the data and tries to group similar items together. For example, if you give a computer a bunch of photos of animals, it might group together all the photos of animals with fur, those with feathers, and those with scales, even though it doesn't know the names of the animals.

- **Dimensionality Reduction:**
Sometimes data has too many details, and it’s hard to see the big picture. Dimensionality reduction helps by simplifying the data, keeping the important parts, and removing the unnecessary ones. It's like taking a complex recipe and simplifying it down to just the key steps.

Why is unsupervised learning useful?
It helps in situations where we don’t have labeled data or when we want the computer to discover hidden patterns we might not notice ourselves. It’s often used in things like grouping customers by their shopping habits, detecting fraud, recommending movies or products, and much more.

*In short, unsupervised learning lets computers explore and make sense of data on their own, helping us find patterns and insights without needing to guide them every step of the way!*

## K-Means

K-Means is one of the simplest and most popular methods in unsupervised learning. It’s used to group similar items into clusters. Think of it like organizing your photo gallery: the algorithm automatically groups photos that look similar, like beach photos in one group and city photos in another.

Here’s how K-Means works, step by step:

1. **Pick the Number of Clusters (K):**
First, you decide how many groups (or clusters) you want. This number is called K. For example, if you have a collection of animal photos and you want to separate them into 3 groups—say, cats, dogs, and birds—you set K = 3.

2. **Place Random Points (Centroids):**
The algorithm starts by placing K points randomly in your data. These points are called centroids, and they represent the center of each cluster. At this stage, they’re just guesses—they don’t mean anything yet.

3. **Assign Each Item to the Nearest Centroid:**
Next, the algorithm looks at each data point and checks which centroid is closest. It then assigns each data point to the nearest centroid, forming temporary clusters. Imagine drawing a line from each photo to the nearest “center” point—it’s like sorting your photos into piles based on which centroid they’re closest to.

4. **Move the Centroids:**
Now that the items are grouped, the centroids move. Each centroid shifts to the center of its assigned group. For example, if you have a cluster of dog photos, the centroid moves to the middle of that group.

5. **Repeat Until It’s Done:**
Steps 3 and 4 keep repeating:
This loop continues until the centroids don’t move much anymore. That’s when the algorithm stops.

## Tools I Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models.
- **Pandas:** Essential for handling and analyzing structured data with ease and efficiency.
- **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and managing multi-dimensional arrays, providing a solid foundation for data processing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Powerful libraries for creating insightful visualizations, helping to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** A versatile machine learning library for building, training, and evaluating models.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to code editor for writing, organizing, and debugging Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Crucial for version control and collaborating, ensuring my work is well-documented and accessible.
